# Freqbench-Sorter
This Python script utilizes a sorting algorithm to analyze the results of frequency benchmarking and eliminate as many inefficient frequencies as possible. The sorting algorithm is heavily inspired by the work of Panchajanya1999 and can be found at this GitHub link: https://github.com/Panchajanya1999/msm-4.14/commit/b45fdff. The algorithm has been adapted and implemented in this script to process and sort frequency benchmark data effectively, customized to suit the specific needs of the benchmarking task at hand. It serves as a useful tool for analyzing and organizing frequency benchmark results in a meaningful and efficient manner.
